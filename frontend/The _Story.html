<p>The story happens throughout the late 1900's, and resolves around Airitech Industries- a massive company envolved in energy, Weapons, and war machines. Everything about this stroies universe is the same to ours, other than the fact that Albert Einstein wasn't the main scientist. Instead the scientist of the name was Ari Teck, a german scientist who built the worlds first nucular reactor instead of the worlds first nucular bomb. The government converted it to a nucular bomb and nuked Japan. After WW2 and the devestation left from the necular demonstrations that ended it; Ari founded Airitech Industries, made to study and develope nucular energy. As time passes it goes into other fields of war. Just after the turn of the 21st century another World War breaks out, WW3. A supposed Russian coupe of the American government that fails, sparks the war. In truth, as discovered later on, it is actually Airitech Industries that stages the red flag coupe. Airitech Industries, now spread across the globe, and basically having it's own millitary, squash the worlds governments armies while they were spread to thin. The Vistor being Airitech Industries, writes the history as them as the savior. The waring governments of old seeking evermore power, turned upon themselves and brought our world to the brink of collapse. . . not everyone bought their narative</p><br>
<center>Factions in the Game</center>
<p>Airitech Industries: The R&D company that Ari Teck founded. After Ari's death  in 1968, the company branched out into military technology. Millitary crafts, traditional and chemical weapons now open to them because there was no moralistic Einstein at the head of the company. By the start of the 21st century they were heavily encroached in global politics.</p>
<p>Vargr Industries: Airitech Industries Black Military used for their dirty work. Basicaly a group of grade A soldiers that do anything at the beck and call of Airitech Industries. They are the ones that stages the failed coupe that triggered WW3. They also in the past, through cooperating with certain governments, have performed coupes and other military exercises on the governments orders, just under the name of Darkwater.</p>
<p>US Government: History is the same (with small modifications to tailor to story) Modern WW3 President __name____ is a strong leader with military expertise. His expertise and confidence in his army leads to him spreading himself to thin and leaving an opening for Airitech Industries. The US is still the  largest millitary</p>
<p>Chinease Government: China, possesing one of the worlds largest cyber spy networks knew something was going down before it happened. It didn't necesarily know what. . . but it was something. After the "failed coupe" China sides with Russia.</p>
<p>Russian Government: Still led by Putin (thinking we should try to make fun of putin here somehow. . .in a way that won't alienate the Russians). Since he did not order the coupe, but doesn't know if one of his generals got to ambitious he is cought some what flat footed in the beginning of the war. the first missile strikes sent in retaliation to the coupe devastate his naval bases. Seeking the easiest way, putin invased the US through Alaska.</p>
<p>The United African Nation: Around 2025 the African continent unifies its borders, creating the worlds largest country, and the fourth in military strength. Their leader, a strong nationalist tired of everyone seemingly misteating people of his country. . . They Go Rogue and go after everyone.</p>
<p>United Nation: A once power and involved entity in the world, the UN now seems to be mild mannered paper pushers, more keen on levying a fine instead of lifting arms to defend if needed. Doesn't matter anyhow, First days of the war right after the US's retalition/attack towards Russia, they were nuked.</p>
<p>Great Britain: Is sitting this one out, drinking a lager and watching us blow everyone up.</p>
