<p>The story happens throughout the late 1900s and resolves around Airitech Industries- a massive company involved in energy, Weapons, and war machines. Everything about this universe is the same as ours, other than the fact that Albert Einstein wasn't the main scientist. Instead, the scientist of the name was Ari Teck, a german scientist who built the world's first nuclear reactor instead of the world's first nuclear bomb. The government converted it to a nuclear bomb and nuked Japan. After WW2 and the devastation left by the nuclear demonstrations that ended it; Ari founded Airitech Industries, made to study and develop nuclear energy. As time passes it goes into other fields of war. Just after the turn of the 21st century, another World War breaks out, WW3. A supposed Russian coupe of the American government that fails, sparks the war. In truth, as discovered, later on, it is Airitech Industries that stages the red flag coupe. Airitech Industries, now spread across the globe and having its millitary, squash the governments of the world armies while they were spread too thin. The Victor being Airitech Industries writes the history as them as the savior. The governments of old seeking evermore power, turned upon themselves and brought our world to the brink of collapse. . . not everyone bought their narrative</p><br>
<center>Factions in the Game</center>
<p>Airitech Industries: The R&D company that Ari Teck founded. After Ari died in 1968, the company branched out into military technology. Military crafts, and traditional and chemical weapons now open to them because there was no moralistic Einstein at the head of the company. By the start of the 21st century, they were heavily encroached in global politics.</p>
<p>Vargr Industries: Airitech Industries Black Military used for their dirty work. Basically a group of grade A soldiers that do anything at the beck and call of Airitech Industries. They are the ones that staged the failed coupe that triggered WW3. They also in the past, through cooperating with certain governments, have performed coupes and other military exercises on the governments' orders, just under the name of Darkwater.</p>
<p>US Government: History is the same (with small modifications to tailor to the story) Modern WW3 President __name____ is a strong leader with military expertise. His expertise and confidence in his army lead to him spreading himself too thin and leaving an opening for Airitech Industries. The US is still the largest military</p>
<p>Chinese Government: China, possesing one of the worlds largest cyber spy networks knew something was going down before it happened. It didn't necessarily know what. . . but it was something. After the "failed coupe" China sides with Russia.</p>
<p>Russian Government: Still led by Putin. Since he did not order the coupe, but doesn't know if one of his generals got too ambitious he is caught somewhat flat-footed at the beginning of the war. the first missile strikes sent in retaliation to the coupe devastate his naval bases. Seeking the easiest way, Putin invaded the US through Alaska.</p>
<p>The United African Nation: Around 2025 the African continent unified its borders, creating the world's largest country, and the fourth in military strength. Their leader, a strong nationalist tired of everyone seemingly mistreating people of his country. . . They Go Rogue and go after everyone. </p>
<p>United Nations: A once powerful and involved entity in the world, the UN now seems to be mild-mannered paper pushers, keener on levying a fine instead of lifting arms to defend if needed. Doesn't matter anyhow, First days of the war right after the US's retaliation/attack towards Russia, the HQ was nuked.</p>
<p>Great Britain: Is sitting this one out, drinking a lager and watching us blow everyone up.</p>
