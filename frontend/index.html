      <div class="flex">
        <h2>Phase 0<h2>
          <h3>A History</h3>
          <p>In January of 2020 I delved deep into the field of blockchain. I was fascinated by it; but not only that- I saw our financial future in it. Decentralized currency, controlled not by a select few but by all. I needed to live in this future world now!<br>I started planning away with my business partner. After planning for a year and a half it is time to make this a reality!<br> Our entry point will be the NFT markets, but our project is so much more that that. We plan to bring the community together by having a local internet cafe, and a global presence by 2026; meaning global impact!</p>
          <h2>Geting Real About It</h2>
          <h3>Bootstrapping</h3>
          <p>We are approaching this with a bootstrap mentality. We mean to go far with this project and will be reinvesting the majority of our profits back into the project. We are wanting to stay away from venture capitalits and "big money". We would rather fund ourselves from our loyal community members through the sales of our products. We are Going to start a Kickstarter campaign to accelate our initial growth.</p>
        <h2>PHASE 1</h2>
        <h3>August 2022</h3>
        <p><u>Mecha Prototype Project Goes Live</u> August 10th the Pre-Forge will open, August 15th the Public Forge commences</p><p>Launch Kick Starter Campaign</p>

      <p><strong>@ Anonymity Industries</strong> we aim to bring the community together. Having a central hub to talk to someone seems to be antiquated approach in this day and age that we find ourselves in but that is the exact thing from stopping the main pupolace from joining us.The face of <Strong>Anonymity Industries</Strong> will be a combination between an Internet Cafe and an event center. Powered by crypto, and renewable resources we will be empowering local business through mutually benefitial partnerships and setting up outreach programs targeting drug abuse, hunger, and income disparity in our local comunities. Our home base is in Albuquerque, New Mexico; but we plan on having global presence by 2026.
